# Ubit: Ethereum â†” Ubit

Ubit native bridge between Ethereum and Ubit is used to relay the Ubit native token from Ubit to Ethereum network

## Architecture Overview

The Ubit bridged is based on POA's bridge implementation, it is used to transfer Ubit tokens between the Ubit chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's Ubit or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender. The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of Ubit tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events of relaying the block rewards to the Ethereum network:

**Mint block reward distributed on the Ubit chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on Ubit chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on Ubit chain, waiting for all bridge validators on Ubit chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

## Contracts

## How to use

On Ubit you send native Ubit token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the Ubit token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the Ubit token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the Ubit native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
