  Ubit Multi UBIT20 bridge is used to relay the UBIT20 tokens between Ubit and
  Ethereum networks.

# Multi ERC-20: Ethereum â†” Ubit

## Architecture Overview

This bridge is two layer bridge. In the base level the  Arbitrary Message Bridge \(AMB\) is responsible for relaying messages between the networks. On top of the AMB,  the pluggable mediators implement a contract logic of token relaying of various assets.

## How to use

Any UBIT20 token can be bridged for Ethereum to the Ubit. If the token is relayed for the first time. A bridged token, paired with the original token, will be created on the Ubit network. 

To send token from the Ethereum network:

1. Approve the UBIT20 tokens to be spent by the Foreign UBIT20 bridge. 
2. Call relayTokens function on the bridge contract

the `relayTokens` method will lock the UBIT20 tokens on the foreign bridge. After a couple of confirmations, an equal amount of the Ubit UBIT20 token will be sent from the home bridge contract.

To send tokens from Ubit network

1. Approve the UBIT20 tokens to be spent by the Home UBIT20 bridge. 
2. Call `relayTokens` function on the bridge contract

the `relayTokens` method will lock the bridged tokens on the home bridge. Then, an equal amount of the paired UBIT20 token will be sent from the foreign bridge contract.
