  Binance Smart Chain (BSC) networks

# Ubit Native: BSC ↔ Ubit

## Architecture Overview

This bridge is two layer bridge. In the base level the Arbitrary Message Bridge \(AMB\) is responsible for relaying messages between the networks. On top of the AMB,  the pluggable mediators implement a contract logic of token relaying of various assets.

## Contracts

Home side of the bridge on the Ubit network: [0xf9b276A1A05934ccD953861E8E59c6Bc428c8cbD](https://ubitscan.com/address/0xf9b276A1A05934ccD953861E8E59c6Bc428c8cbD/transactions)

Foreign side of the bridge on the BSC network: [0x61A8287fA7a9f4D10F4699BC2aE77f962DC508B6](https://etherscan.io/address/0x61A8287fA7a9f4D10F4699BC2aE77f962DC508B6)

Ubit token on the BSC network: [0x5857c96DaE9cF8511B08Cb07f85753C472D36Ea3](https://bscscan.com/token/0x5857c96dae9cf8511b08cb07f85753c472d36ea3)

Home side of the AMB bridge on the Ubit network: [0x1ee6E3E3d2DE779858728E157B3B9C488bA7b706](https://ubitscan.com/address/0x1ee6E3E3d2DE779858728E157B3B9C488bA7b706)

Foreign side of the AMB bridge on the BSC network: [0x3A5A320a2f98a3Fe39c9040e7e3E9caA7F0D5bd6](https://bscscan.com/address/0x3A5A320a2f98a3Fe39c9040e7e3E9caA7F0D5bd6)

## How to use

To send token from the Ubit network:

Send native Ubit token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the Ubit token on the BSC network, sent from the foreign bridge contract.

To send token from the BSC network:

1. Approve the Ubit UBIT20 tokens to be spent by the Foreign UBIT20 bridge. 
2. Call relayTokens function on the bridge contract

the `relayTokens` method will lock the UBIT20 tokens on the foreign bridge. After a couple of confirmations, an equal amount of the Ubit UBIT20 token will be released from the home bridge contract on BSC.
